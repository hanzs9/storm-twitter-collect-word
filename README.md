### Aims

The assignment aims to predict the outcome of UK 2019 general election on the 12th December 2019. There are mainly five parties participating in this election which are Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrats, Green or Brexit party respectively. In this assignment, I will use a real time analytic tool to analyse the information from Twitter and count the number of supporters for each party. Then, I will sort the supporters in different districts by getting usersâ€™ geographic locations. Finial, I will predict the election by which party has the most supporters. After the general election, we can know the result of the election and I will do a comparison between my prediction and the actual result.
